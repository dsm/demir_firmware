# DEMIR (Dynamically Enhanced Motor Intelligence for Robots)
I started this project for my final year project.

DEMIR is close-loop motor driver platform hardware and software based on atmega328p and vnh7070.

It has encoder based PID position controller with profile generation capability.

give some information later.
